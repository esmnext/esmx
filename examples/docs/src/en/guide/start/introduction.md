# Introduction

## Project Background
Esmx is a modern micro-frontend framework based on ECMAScript Modules (ESM), specializing in building high-performance, scalable server-side rendered (SSR) applications. As the third-generation product of the Genesis project, Esmx has continuously innovated through its technical evolution:

- **v1.0**: Implemented on-demand remote component loading via HTTP requests
- **v2.0**: Achieved application integration through Webpack Module Federation
- **v3.0**: Redesigned the [Module Linking](/guide/essentials/module-link) system based on native browser ESM

## Technical Context
During the development of micro-frontend architectures, traditional solutions primarily faced the following limitations:

### Challenges with Existing Solutions
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Runtime dependency injection and JavaScript sandbox proxying introduced significant performance overhead
- **Isolation Mechanisms**: Custom sandbox environments struggled to match native browser module isolation capabilities
- **Build Complexity**: Build tool modifications for dependency sharing increased project maintenance costs
- **Standard Deviation**: Special deployment strategies and runtime processing mechanisms deviated from modern web development standards
- **Ecosystem Constraints**: Framework coupling and custom APIs limited technology stack choices

### Technological Innovations
Esmx provides a novel solution based on modern web standards:

- **Native Module System**: Leverages browser-native ESM and Import Maps for dependency management, delivering faster parsing and execution
- **Standard Isolation**: Reliable application isolation through ECMAScript module scoping
- **Open Technology Stack**: Supports seamless integration with any modern frontend framework
- **Optimized Developer Experience**: Offers intuitive development patterns and comprehensive debugging capabilities
- **Performance Optimization**: Achieves zero runtime overhead through native capabilities combined with intelligent caching strategies

:::tip
Esmx focuses on building high-performance, easily extensible micro-frontend infrastructure, particularly suited for large-scale server-side rendering applications.

## Technical Specifications

### Environment Requirements
Refer to the [Environment Requirements](/guide/start/environment) documentation for detailed browser and Node.js version requirements.

### Core Technology Stack
- **Dependency Management**: Uses [Import Maps](https://caniuse.com/?search=import%20map) for module resolution with [es-module-shims](https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-shims) for compatibility
- **Build System**: Leverages Rspack's [module-import](https://rspack.dev/config/externals#externalstypemodule-import) for external dependency handling
- **Development Toolchain**: Supports ESM hot module replacement and native TypeScript execution

## Framework Positioning
Esmx differs from [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) or [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/) by focusing on micro-frontend infrastructure:

- **Module Linking System**: Enables efficient and reliable module import/export
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Provides flexible SSR implementation mechanisms
- **Type System Support**: Includes comprehensive TypeScript type definitions
- **Framework Agnostic**: Supports integration with mainstream frontend frameworks

## Architecture Design

### Centralized Dependency Management
- **Unified Dependency Source**: Centralized third-party dependency management
- **Automated Distribution**: Global synchronization for dependency updates
- **Version Consistency**: Precise dependency version control

### Modular Design
- **Separation of Concerns**: Decouples business logic from infrastructure
- **Plugin Mechanism**: Supports flexible module composition and replacement
- **Standardized Interfaces**: Normalized inter-module communication protocols

### Performance Optimization
- **Zero Overhead Principle**: Maximizes utilization of native browser capabilities
- **Intelligent Caching**: Content hash-based precise caching strategy
- **On-Demand Loading**: Granular code splitting and dependency management

## Project Maturity
Through nearly 5 years of iterative development (v1.0 to v3.0), Esmx has been thoroughly validated in enterprise environments. Currently supporting dozens of production projects, it continues to drive modernization of technology stacks. The framework's stability, reliability, and performance advantages have been fully proven in practice, providing a solid technical foundation for large-scale application development.
